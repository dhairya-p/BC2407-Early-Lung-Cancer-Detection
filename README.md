**SUMMARY**<br><br>
This report seeks to understand the factors that contribute to lung cancer so as to find out the best methods we are able to utilise to identify individuals with high risks of lung cancer. 
The majority of lung cancer cases are detected at advanced stages, significantly diminishing the effectiveness of treatments and survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods, including manual pathology analysis and diagnosing techniques, are plagued by inefficiencies, subjective interpretations, and long diagnosis intervals, necessitating the exploration of more accurate and efficient detection strategies. This, combined with a global shortage of pathologists and increased lung cancer risk factors like smoking, vaping, and air pollution, underscores the need for innovative solutions.
To address this pressing issue, we utilised a dataset found from Kaggle, reflecting the intricacies of lung cancer diagnosis, to develop and assess predictive models utilising cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques. The project was initiated with meticulous data cleaning followed by an exploration phase using Tableau and Python. This phase aimed to distil a deeper understanding of the dataset and pinpoint influential variables associated with lung cancer risk.
Our analysis made use of 6 analytical models to aid in our analysis: Association Rules, Linear Regression, Random Forest Generator, XGBoost, Convolutional Neural Networks, and lastly, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). We also made use of a dataset consisting of images to run our Convolutional Neural Networks. Each model was then evaluated for their diagnostic precision, accuracy and overall ability to detect and aid in the diagnosis of lung cancer.
Key findings from our models demonstrated promising capabilities in identifying lung cancer markers, with the CNN model showcasing exceptional accuracy in image analysis for detecting benign and malignant cases. As well as our XGBoost model excelling at prediction of the presence of Lung Cancer through personal and symptomatic indicators. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential operational benefits of integrating these models into clinical practice, including enhancing diagnostic workflows, facilitating early interventions, and optimising resource allocation.
Moreover, the report outlines strategic recommendations for hospitals to adopt these technologies, including forming partnerships with research institutions, and ensuring continuous model improvement to keep pace with medical advancements. While acknowledging limitations such as model interpretability and integration challenges, the report suggests future suggestions for investments in data interpretation tools and applying AI in prognosis prediction to refine lung cancer diagnostic processes further.
In conclusion, leveraging machine learning for lung cancer detection marks a critical advancement towards transforming healthcare diagnostics. By prioritising early detection and accuracy, the proposed models have the potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes and reduce the healthcare impact of lung cancer.
